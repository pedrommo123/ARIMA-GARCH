## Introduction
In this repository, I have compiled various projects and assignments I completed during my university studies that revolve around market risk analysis and portfolio optimization. These projects include the implementation of GARCH  models to model market volatility and the application of Harry Markowitz's portfolio theory to optimize investment portfolios.

## Content
Here's an overview of the projects and files included in this repository:

1. **GARCH_Models**: This directory contains code and documentation related to GARCH modeling, including time series data analysis, volatility forecasting, and model evaluation.

2. **Portfolio_Optimization**: Here, you'll find code and reports on portfolio optimization using Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). This includes asset allocation, risk-return analysis, and efficient frontier calculations.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the projects and code within this repository. You can clone the repository to your local machine to run the code and analyze the results. Each project directory contains its own README with specific instructions on how to use the code.

If you find these projects helpful or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

Thank you for visiting my portfolio repository! I hope you find the projects here insightful and informative.
